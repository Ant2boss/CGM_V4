**CGM_V4**
CGM is a console addon which enables simple 2D 8-bit graphics.

CGM is written using MicrosoftVisualStudio, however you should be able to adapt it to whatever your editor of choice is. If you wish to use Visual studio, the project should come with an .sln, which allows you to instatnly open the project.
If I ever figure out how to use C-make I'll probably put that up on GitHub instad

Documentation coming soon...

**CGM is Windows only, as it requieres Windows.h for its core functionality**

**C++ / Windows.h / Console**
